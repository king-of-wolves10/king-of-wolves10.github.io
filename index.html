<h2>Looks like you've wandered and found my website, pretty nifty isn't it?</h2>


<p>My name is King of Wolves, you might know me from <a href="https://www.neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=king_of_wolves10">Neopets</a>. One day, I tried to make a guild for the 
<br>purpouse of getting teammates to make a game with, because doing it all alone can get lonely. <br>Unfortunately, it proved difficult to do this without linking to other websites, as a result, I got my first warning on Neopets.<br><br>

But now! I have my OWN website, meaning I can do whatever I want!<br>
<a href="pages/GuildGame.html">You can find information of my game here</a>
<br><br>

<p>

April 17th 2025<br><br>
Added a brand new sidebar that has a map,
blog, and links to other cool websites I found,
like the header and footer, JavaScript needs to be
enabled for this to work<br><br>

I also added a new game, "My Maze", it lets you explore the maze
I built in Minecraft without actually firing up the game!.. It's
still a boring maze though. I plan to add more features, but the likelyhood
of that with me is low. Speaking of Minecraft, theres a new page in About Me
dedicated to Minecraft! Filled with splash text and a secreet that I'm not allowed
to tell you ;D<br><br>

I <b>also</b> added a page called "Fun Stuff" for... fun! I thought the website could
use some character.<br><br>

<b>Bonus:</b> I made a cool banner picture.

Melon Head no longer has his page, because the videos<br>
he made were too long to be resonably compressed to 25MB for<br>
Github Pages rules. And his page was mainly about them.<br>
<br>
I added background pictures to some of the pages
so they can look cooler.

My brother dino_warrior5 has his own page, but he prefers
the alias "Melon Head", you can check it out by clicking the
emblem on the top left. Also, some new videos are coming out soon
as evidenced by the new videos page! The videos have already been
made, but need to be compressed for GitHub.

I updated the site's look, tried to make it look cool<br>
Added more pages, to make each page have a specific topic<br>
Changed the header to be rendered with JavaScript, so it'll stay the same for every page, even new ones<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I do pretty much whatever I can think of, I don't think there could be any limit to what I do, as long as I try hard enough.<br>
<br>
I like to program and play video games, whenever I think of a nice game idea I try to program it, and if it fails, I'll probably try again in the future.<br>
Although, ideas come pretty frequently, so I tend to have too much projects, leaving some to bite the dust.<br><br>

<b>Program languages I know</b>

<tr><th>Name</th><th>Skill rating</th></tr>

<tr><td>Roblox (Lua) </td><td>7/10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Javascript</td><td>8/10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sega Genesis Dev Kit [C]</td><td>3/10</td></tr>

<sub>These rating are based on how confident I feel that I can make a game with the language</sub>
<br>
<a href="pages/aboutme.html">Information on the games I play and how you can play with me, are written here</a>
<br><br>
Occasionally, when inspiration strikes, I'll draw a picture. First times usually appear rough, but I know I'll do better later
<br><sub>I'm looking at you, first Draconik drawing... I didn't even get the wing flapping right.</sub>
