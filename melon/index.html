<p> Heya, it's me, MelonHead! <br> 
I got my brother to help me make my own section on his website. Which I'm still working on currently, consider this a prototype for now. <br>
So what exactly do I do here? Well, I could post my stuff here cause boy do I have stuff, like <br>
<b> Song Covers and Drawings, <br> </b>
As well as talk about games, and do challanges and stuff, all of which you can check out by using the toolbar on the top. <br>
<br> <br>
As for information about myself, well, I'm just a dumb teenager trying 
to find something to do in hopes of being interesting, and making my way
 through life. <br>
I want to become either a voice actor or an actor when I get older, but 
between you and me, I'm not very confident I can do that. <br>
<br>
I spend a lot of time with my friends, who I love very much, cause 
without them, I'd be a depressed mess and a lot of what I do wouldn't 
happen. <br> </p>

    <td>Perry</td>
    <td> Formerly a Platypus, Perry is a very queer friend in many ways, and is as helpful and kind as he is weird, Like Master Roshi. <br>
 I met him in a game of Team Fortress 2 on Doublecross, where I was 
feeling super down and like I couldn't do anything, when he saw himself 
in me and acted more kind then anyone I ever knew at the time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Boaty the Bard</td>
    <td>Boaty is the sweetest person you could ever ask for simply put, She's nice, caring, and very sweet, it's hard not to be around her and smile <br> I met her in a game of Team Fortress 2 on Granary, I was bored and I just commentated the entire round. <br> She thought it was funny, so she friended me and I accepted and I've never looked back, I'm so lucky to have her in my life..</td>

    <td>bartisfunny64</td>
    <td>An old friend of mine, the first friend I ever felt close to, We met on Typical Colors 2 (A Roblox TF2 Knockoff) on the Himalaya map, where he was trolling me. <br> Somehow we became close friends, but now things have been kind of distant again.</td>
