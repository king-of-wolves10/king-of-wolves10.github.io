<h2>Guilds Game</h2>
<sub>Currently unnamed</sub><br><br>






<p>The game concept is a 2D platformer similar to 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqb1D9_RCpo" title="Click to watch a video of the game">Decap Attack</a> or 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcOj1JeM6Pk" title="Click to watch a video of the game">Kid Chameleon.</a><br>
starring a Lizard or some kind of fictional reptile, that can change into many kinds of Dinosaurs and Dragons,<br> or other reptilian creatures via power-ups!<br>
<br>

<p>
The game should appeal to a general audience, much like the refrenced games above.

This game was originally going to star <a href="https://wikimon.net/Guilmon">Guilmon</a>, from <a href="wikimon.net/Digimon_Tamers" title="Season 3">Digimon Tamers</a>, and the power-ups were DigiModify cards, <br>
but it was too difficult being restricted to the Digimon Tamers universe, so I thought to just get rid of all Digimon related stuff.<br><br>

<summary >Plot</summary>

<div>
<p>
You're a Lizard in a test lab, trapped in a glass container.
A scientist injects the player with something unknown. This causes the player to feel ill and start shaking.
Suddenly, glass shatters, and the table below you crashes to the ground. The sceintist flees for cover, to avoid
the glass. Once he uncovers, he sees that the player has turned to a velociraptor, but before he could celebrate,
the player runs through the wall and over yonder before he has the chance to catch you. He is the main antagonist.

<br>
<h2>Your motive</h2>
You wish to be free of all experiments, and find yourself someplace home.<br>
<h2>His motive</h2>
He wishes to control you, and profit out of his discovery

The game is a 2D Platformer. You must reach a goal at the end of the level to win.
The main gimmick is the powerup system, there will be three kinds of powerups. Strength, Speed, Jump.
Collecting a combination of these will morph you into different things. The more you collect, the stronger you are.
Getting hit as will make you lose a heart, when all hearts are lost, you'll lose your form, or worse, die if you have
no form (lizard).<br><br>

Some forms I've thought about adding:
<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Life</th><th>Power</th></tr>
<tr><th>Lizard</th><th>1</th><th>STR: 0, SPD: 0, JMP: 0</th></tr>
<tr><td>Western Dragon</td><td>Invincible, for a limited time</td><td>STR: 5, SPD: 5, JMP: 4 (flight) </td></tr>
<tr><td>Eastern Dragon</td><td>Invincible, for a limited time</td><td>STR: 7, SPD: 7, JMP: 7 (flight, no gravity)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Crocodile</td><td>2</td><td>STR: 3, SPD: 1, JMP: 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Triceritops</td><td>3</td><td>STR: 3, SPD: 3, JMP: 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Velociraptor</td><td>2</td><td>STR: 2, SPD: 3, JMP: 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pterodactyl</td><td>2</td><td>STR: 1, SPD: 3, JMP: 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frog</td><td>1</td><td>STR: 0, SPD: 1, JMP: 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gecko</td><td>1</td><td>STR: 0, SPD: 2, JMP: 2</td></tr>

</table>

In order to become a Dragon of any kind, you'll have to collect a lot of powerups without getting hit, which will be tricky.
Fortunatly, Forms will stay in between levels.
