<h2>How to make your own website</h2>
<br>
<p>This shows instructions for making a GitHub pages website, which will have all of the files and scripts visible on the repository, so this may be undesired for some.<br>There are other ways of creating a website, but they're not as easy as this.</p>

<br><br>
This is a question asked by a friend of mine called <a href="https://neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=me_r_cy">me_r_cy</a>. The first step to making a website,<br>
is to have a GitHub account, if you don't have one, you'll have to make a new one and come back. <br><br>
<a href="https://github.com/signup">Click here to make a GitHub account</a><br><br>
Once you have created one, you must make a new repository, name it <span style='color:aqua'>username</span>.github.io<br>
replace <span style='color:aqua'>username</span> with your username. When done you should see a screen like this.<br>
<img src='ex1.jpg' style='padding: 20; width: 60%;'></img><br>
Click <span class="fakelink" title="Sorry, this is a fake link">creating a new file</span> and name your file "index.html" and design your page, click Commit to finish.<br>

Once commited, you should click Settings, click the Pages tab on the sidebar, and below Build and deployment, <br>there will be a save button. Click it and wait a few minutes, your site should be online! You should see a message below where it says GitHub Pages,<br> "Your site is live at https://<span style='color:aqua'>username</span>.github.io/".<br><br>

I would recommend creating an .html file on your computer before airing it. That way, you can make changes faster.<br>
GitHub will only update your page ~5 minutes after you change it.<br><br><br>

  me_r_cy.. where are you? I hope you're doing fine.
