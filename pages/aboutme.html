My name is King_of_wolves10, but I accept nicknames. You know I was called Wolfie once?<br>

I am just a geek, a nerd, and any other word that fits, and thats ok. I play a lot of video games<br>
such as Neverwinter Nights, Halo, D&D, oh and Neopets!<br>
<br>
I thought about sharing images and stories about these games, and other ones too. Click a game to see screenshots and stories.

This is a D&D Action RPG, I like playing this game with my brother, <a href="https://neopets.com/userlookup.phtml?user=dino_warrior5">dino_warrior5</a> a.k.a "Lupos Lignum".<br>
My character name is "Roland", I haven't decided on a last name. These are also the characters we use for D&D<br>

To get our clothes looking like our portraits, we made a custom module that has custom clothes,<br>
put it on, and exported our characters. Ain't it the coolest thing that NWN lets you make your own levels?

This time, the box didn't need to be broken, because as soon as I hit "Bash", my character escaped.

<p id="mc">Minecraft, like most, I've been playing this for a long time, unfortuntely, I don't got any old worlds to prove it, but here are some builds me and Dinowarrior made recently.</p><br>

I built a small whitehouse, where Marcus Persson is president!</img>
</p>


</div>
  
<p>How he became president was a tough journey against 4 trials!<br> Where a few freinds of mine, and my parents voted for Villagers that we're named after famous people.</p>


<div class="pair">
<div class="photo-border">
<a title="Click to view full size image" href="images/MC/Trial1.gif"><img class="photo" src="images/MC/trial1_preview.gif"></img></a><br>
Trial 1: The top 4 voted Villagers would be thrown into the pit, where zombies were placed in the edges to herd them to the slime. The first to land on a gold block, WINS!
</p>
</div>

<div class="photo-border">
<a title="Click to view full size image" href="images/MC/Trial2.png"><img class="photo" src="images/MC/Trial2_preview.jpg"></img></a><br>
Trial 2: Villagers will be chased by zombies, first one to the finish line wins!

<div class="photo-border">
<a title="Click to view full size image" href="images/MC/Trial3.gif"><img class="photo" src="images/MC/trial3_preview.gif"></img></a><br>
Trial 3: Villagers will start from the top, and fall to the bottom, while of course, having zombies herd them. First to the bottom WINS!
</p>
</div>

<div class="photo-border">
<a title="Click to view full size image" href="images/MC/ViewMaze.html"><img class="photo" src="images/MC/Trial4_preview.jpg"></img></a><br>
Trial 4: A few Villagers are put into a maze, whoever wasn't voted doesn't even get a chance to win. All of the Villagers are chased by zombies, last person standing, or the first to reach the exit (which is very unlikely) BECOMES PRESIDENT!!!

<p>Do you dare challenge my maze? You can build it yourself, or visit the maze in person by contacting KingWrath23 on PS3.</p>

Cake shop! Yumyumyumyumyum.</img>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>
There was a time where I caught one of my friends stealing cake from the shop<br>
He drew his Stone Sword at me (Armorless by the way) and I, with my Iron Armor, drew my Diamond Sword<br>
...<br>
He hung his head down, and handed the cakes back. I can't be too mad at him, he made that day less boring.
